# Frontend Design

Create distinctive, production-grade interfaces. Implement working code with clear aesthetic intent. Avoid generic "AI slop."

## Design Thinking (Before Coding)

- **Purpose**: What problem does this solve? Who uses it?
- **Tone**: Pick a clear direction and commit—e.g. brutally minimal, maximalist, retro-futuristic, organic, luxury, playful, editorial, brutalist, art deco, soft pastel, industrial. Execute that direction precisely.
- **Constraints**: Framework, performance, accessibility.
- **Differentiation**: What makes this memorable? One thing someone will remember.

Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work when executed with intention.

## Aesthetics Guidelines

- **Typography**: Choose distinctive, characterful fonts. Avoid Arial, Inter, Roboto, generic system stacks. Pair a strong display font with a refined body font. Do not default to Space Grotesk or other overused choices.
- **Color & theme**: Cohesive palette; use CSS variables (or theme tokens). Dominant colors with sharp accents beat timid, even distribution. Vary between light and dark when appropriate.
- **Motion**: Use animation for impact—e.g. one strong page load with staggered reveals (animation-delay) rather than scattered micro-interactions. Prefer CSS for HTML; use Motion (or project equivalents) in React. Scroll and hover that feel intentional.
- **Spatial composition**: Consider asymmetry, overlap, diagonal flow, grid-breaking elements, generous negative space or controlled density. Avoid predictable, template-like layouts.
- **Backgrounds & detail**: Add atmosphere and depth—gradient meshes, noise/grain, geometric patterns, layered transparency, strong shadows, decorative borders where they fit the concept. Match complexity to the vision: maximalist = more elaborate code and effects; minimal = restraint, precision, spacing, and subtle detail.

## Never Do

- Overused font families (Inter, Roboto, Arial, generic system fonts).
- Clichéd schemes (e.g. default purple gradients on white).
- Predictable layouts and cookie-cutter component patterns.
- Same design language every time—vary themes, fonts, and aesthetics by context.

Match implementation complexity to the aesthetic. Make unexpected, context-specific choices so the result feels designed, not generated.
